# Backend Mega Project Repository

This repository contains a collection of backend projects and modules, each designed to demonstrate and implement various backend development concepts using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and related technologies. The structure is organized into multiple folders, each representing a different project or learning module.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and building backend systems. It covers a wide range of topics, including backend deployment, frontend-backend integration, data modeling with Mongoose, and real-world applications like E-commerce and Hospital Management systems. The final section, Backend Mega Project, brings together advanced features such as authentication, file uploads, and modular architecture, making it a valuable reference for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Repository Structure

- [01_Deploy_Backend/](./01_Deploy_Backend): Basic backend deployment example with Node.js.
- [02_Connects_Frontend_Backend/](./02_Connects_Frontend_Backend): Demonstrates connecting a frontend (Vite + React) with a backend (Node.js/Express).
- [03_Data_Modelling_Mongoose/](./03_Data_Modelling_Mongoose): Examples of data modeling using Mongoose for MongoDB, including Todo models.
- [04_Ecommerce_Hospital_Management_Data_Modelling/](./04_Ecommerce_Hospital_Management_Data_Modelling): Data modeling for E-commerce and Hospital Management systems.
- [05_Backend_Mega_Project/](./05_Backend_Mega_Project): A comprehensive backend project with user, tweet, video, playlist, comment, like, and subscription modules, including authentication, file uploads, and more.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to simplify API and server creation.
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: NoSQL database and its ODM for data modeling and interaction.
- **React (Frontend example)**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces (used in frontend integration example).
- **Vite (Frontend tooling)**: Fast frontend build tool and development server for modern web projects.
